# Keeping track of things

<p>
	If you know me, you are probably aware that I love making tools that keep
	track of things. I also love tools that automate tasks at my job. I recently discovered that there really is no substitute for happiness.
</p>

## Always Learning
  <p>
I recently started watching videos on [frontendmasters.com](https://frontendmasters.com) and found the course material to be excellent! Going through data structures
and algorithms (because everyone needs a refresh sometimes, right?) has actually been a blast! I even implemented a search algorithm in a new way 
using some of the material from the course. 
</p>

  <p> 
    I guess the point that I'm trying to make is that sometimes writing code can get stale. We burn out. We get stumped. When that happens
    it's probably time to take a break. Here are some of the activities I've found incredibly useful for dealing with burnout.

## Music

<p>It has seriously saved me so many times. Playing songs on the guitar helps me untangle my thoughts and it's been my favorite way to decompress.</p>

## Animals

<p>If you don't own a dog (or cat), and you are coding alone, I highly suggest that you get one! </p>
