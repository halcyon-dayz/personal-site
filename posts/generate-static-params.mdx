# A new way to generate static props?

<p>
  Yes.
</p>

<p> 
  So if you are coming from Next 12 you are used to `getStaticProps()` which is all fine and wonderful.
  Now there's a replacement when using the `app` directory, called `generateStaticParams`
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's what it looks like.

  </p>

  <p>
    ```typescript
    export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(path.join("posts"));
  return files.map((filename) => {
    return {
      slug: filename.replace(".mdx", ""),
    };
  });
}
    ```
  </p>
<p>
  Basically the only thing that has changed is that we are returning the params, in this case `slug`, when before we were returning an object `props: {prop: value}`.
  Pretty cool? I guess.  This is actually the version of Next I'm using to run this blog... (I know, why use a framework like Next to deliver static pages, more on that later)

</p>
