# Search, Easy

<p>
 Search can be a pain point for a lot of developers. Luckily for me, I'm using Node.js and my blog posts are .mdx
 files on the filesystem. This makes it quite easy to parse the files using node and return all of the content, and then filter that
 content based on the user's input. Here's what it looks like in just a few lines of code.
</p>

## First, we gotta grab the directory from path and read the contents. 

```typescript
const posts = fs.readdirSync(path.join("posts")).map((filename) => {
  // We will loop through all the files in the directory 
  //and pull the filename for "slug" and the content
}

```

## The next step

```typescript
const posts = fs.readdirSync(path.join("posts")).map((filename) => {
  const slug = filename.replace(".mdx", "");
  const markdownWithMeta = fs.readFileSync(
      path.join("posts", filename),
      "utf-8"
      );
  const { data: frontmatter } = matter(markdownWithMeta);
  return {
  slug,
  frontmatter,
  };
  });

```

## Now that we have the frontmatter and slug, we can pass that down

```typescript
{input !== "" &&
  posts
    .filter(
        (post) =>
        post.frontmatter.title.toLowerCase().includes(input.toLowerCase()) ||
        post.frontmatter.description.toLowerCase().includes(input.toLowerCase())
        )
    .map((post) => (
          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`} onClick={() => setInput("")}>
          <Card className="flex flex-col border-2 border-bg-black">
          <div>{post.frontmatter.title}</div>
          <div>{post.frontmatter.description}</div>
          </Card>
          </Link>
          ))}

```

<p>
  Here we are just looping through the posts object, filtering each post to see if it includes the user search input.
  We change both the input and the data to lowercase using a string method, so that it's not case sensitive. 
  Then we display the results in a link. Pretty simple right?
</p>

<p>
  It's pretty cool that Javascript gives us the ability to implement search algorithms so easily. Without the `filter`
  and `includes` method, we would have to write a LOT of complicated code. It will all be nested with `if..` statements 
  but thanks to `map` we don't need to worry about that. 
</p>

<p>
  With all that said, I would still recommend learning the algorithms, and trying to implement them manually, on a simple
  test project. It's very useful to know what's going on under the hood. Javascript makes programming considerably easier (most of the
  time), but knowing what's going on under the hood allows you to solve your problem in the most practical and efficient way.
